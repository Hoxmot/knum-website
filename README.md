Our website: http://knum.mimuw.edu.pl/

## Dev setup
1. Install [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/) which automates building and provides a hot-reload server for local development.
2. Install [GIT LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) which is used to store images for the page in this repo.
3. Clone this repository.

Page consists of a single template, where all static and CSS files reside, as well as Markdown files that specify content displayed on each of the pages.
When extending the page Hugo instructions and guidelines, everything should be clearly explained there :)
